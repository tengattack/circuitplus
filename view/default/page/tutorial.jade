    h3 Search
    p Input keywords in the Search Box and choose search
      | or press enter. Three searching methods are all available, 
      |by genetic circuit name, by description and by tags. 
      |Search Box can also be found in circuit list and circuit 
      |information pages, which enable searching to be convenient.

    h3 Circuit List
    p Choose a category first to exclude the unneeded results 
      |and then use Search Box to do some keywords matching searching.

    h2.ui.dividing.header Result page
    p When having entered words in the Search Box, press Enter or 
      |click search, a well-designed result page will show up. 
      |The results list is in a certain order. The keywords searched 
      |in the Search Box are highlight to outstand. On the left 
      |section of this page is a list of categories. 
      |The numbers besides some categories indicate the number of 
      |related circuits in these categories. Click one of it to 
      |restrict the result in the category. On top of the page, 
      |some filter and sort options can be found. They all can 
      |optimize the searching experience.

    p In List page, Create button lays under the List button. 
      |Click the Create button and a form will show up. Fill all 
      |required information and accomplish submitting. 
      |Also, Create is accessible in the result page.

    h2.ui.dividing.header Information page
    p After finishing retrieving and click one circuit in the 
      |result list or the deepest level bubble of Mindmap, 
      |an information page will jump out. The information 
      |of a circuit is divided into four parts, information, 
      |LGD, feedback, and comment. We will discuss information here. 
      |The information part holds information defined in RFC , 
      |including basic information, ranking, circuit construct, 
      |input, output, regulatory information 102and result. 
      |Information such as reference is also included. 
      |You can find as many as information that defined in 
      |the RFC standard in a prime way. You can also start 
      |a new search by clicking the tags. The circuits which 
      |have same tag can be found in a result page.

    p As shown in the figure, the relationship between different 
      |biobricks is based on the substance. When you move your 
      |mouse above the picture, you can gain information about 
      |the biobrick.
