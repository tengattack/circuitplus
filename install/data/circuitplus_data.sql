As the signal \"ticks\" the clock, the clock changes color and observer can use the color or combination of colors to tell what \"time\" it is. There are two types of clocks proposed by our team. The first type is a Binary Clock. In the Binary Clock, there are identical units (in fact not totally identical but almost) which are connected in series to make the entire clock. We call each unit a bit-unit. Each bit-unit can be turned on and off by its input signal and give its output as the input signal for the next bit in the series. So for example Bit1 can have 2 states ON or OFF, Bit1\'s output is the input for Bit2 to turn Bit2 ON and OFF. So with 2 bit-units, there are totally for states and these 4 states happen in a sequential order 00 -> 01 -> 02 -> 03, because Bit2\'s input is Bit1\'s output. If we extend to 3 bit-units, the number of possible states will grow exponentially to 8.Each bit-unit is said to be modular because, apart from input receptor and output molecule, the internal machinery are identical.We also proposed a Linear Clock. The linear model is similar to and simpler than the Binary model. The difference is that each bit-unit is turned ON only once and once it is turned OFF by the next bit-unit, it will stay OFF forever. So you can imagine this system as a string of light globes, the light jumps from one globe to the next and people can read the time by just looking at which globe is on.

They cannot be degraded or destroyed. To a small extent they enter our bodies via food, drinking water and air. As trace elements, some heavy metals (e.g. copper, selenium, zinc) are essential to maintain the metabolism of the human body. However, at higher concentrations they can lead to poisoning. Heavy metal poisoning could result, for instance, from drinking-water contamination (e.g. lead pipes), high ambient air concentrations near emission sources, or intake via the food chain.We designed a E.coli machine to control heavy metal concentration in water by using phototaxis induced tunable carrying system on E.coli membrane. In our system, there are two light sources. One of them is for the metal source and another is for the destination to where we want to carry metal atoms. And our machines have phototaxis ability. In addition to this, they have metal binding domain in outer surface and bacteriorhodopsin. When we open light at the metal source, they start to move toward source and catch the metal atoms. Then we open the light at the destination while closing the light at the source. So our machines move toward the destination. After the arrival our machines will be exposed to light with specific wavelength to activate bacteriorhodopsin leading to small local pH changing at the outer surface.

The peptide is considered advantageous because it selectively prevents S. mutans colonization without removing beneficial bacteria that are also present in the mouth. In fact, the removal of S.mutans allows other (unharmful) bacteria to colonize these regions. It was found that introduction of p1025 into the mouth can inhibit S.mutans colonization for up to about 90 days.Our research goal is to engineer one of the common yogurt bacteria, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, to secrets p1025 in yogurt.

Hela cell is a kind of cancer cell that contains a large amount of endogenic mir-21, while the amount of this microRNA in normal cells is rather low. This remarkable difference inspired us to design a network of which the output protein value is related to the input value of mir-21. So a rational GRN is needed to sense input signal and to distinguish cancer cell from normal cell.?Previous research has offered some functional GRNs successfully sensing the difference between high input and low input. We hoped to find out similar network topologies that may also achieve corresponding high-low switch.?However, there exist many complicated factors that may arouse noise during the expression of gene, which leads to instability and lack of efficiency. We noticed that the number of DNA template (copy number) has a great effect as a noise on the expression intensity. Since the actual amount of copy number involved in gene expression process is hard to measure or control precisely, we have to consider adaptation to DNA copy number variation as a key character of a network.?So our goal is to search for a rational GRN that can sense the input signal, realize the switch function and show adaptation to copy number.?Besides, GRN consists of different kinds of regulatory motifs that may play an important role in functioning. We are also motivated to search for certain motifs which contribute to adaptation.Cells with different mir-21 amount response differently towards the input signal and their response may represent state-switch.
