## Introduction

Circuit+, an online registry of standard genetic circuits, aims to fill the vacancy of genetic circuitsâ€™ database and sharing platform. In the database behind, we design several tables to record all kinds of information to comprehensively describe a genetic circuit. All the information we record and require in Create is based on our standard of RFC 97 and RFC 101. Users can retrieve circuits, browse information, share by exporting information in SBOL and submit new circuits. As for sharing platform, we call for users to submit their own genetic circuits and post their comment of other circuits. Furthermore, even average people are allowed and encouraged to upload their crazy ideas to Mindmap. Thus, Circuit+ is a good place for exchanging genetic circuits and obtaining a better understanding about synthetic biology.
